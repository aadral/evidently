# Sample notebooks

Here you can find simple examples on toy datasets to quickly explore what Evidently can do right out of the box. Each shows how to create a default Evidently dashboard, a JSON profile and an HTML report.

To learn how to adjust evidently as you need, refer to the [how-to questions](../how_to_questions/).

To better understand potential use cases (such as model evaluation and monitoring), refer to the [detailed tutorials](../data_stories/) accompanied by the blog posts.

To see how to integrate Evidently in your prediction pipelines and use it with other tools, refer to the [integrations](../integrations/).
